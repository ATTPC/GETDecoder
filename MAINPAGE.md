## How to use this documentation

All the classes are documented in classes tab in the menu. <br>
If you want to know what's going on inside to code, you can look inside the code with explanation there.<br><br>

Also, I've written some notes on example codes. <br>
So, before start to read the classes, try to test examples first. <br><br>
